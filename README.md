# ExpenseEase
Use Case:
A client is looking to create an expense tracker android app for his company. The main use of this app is that his employees will daily enter the expense, which they do on behalf of the company example taxi expense, flight expense, hotel expenses, dinner expense etc. from the android app. At the end of the month, the client will take a summary of all expenses done by his employees and will reimburse them for the expenses they have done on behalf of the company.
Create an android app for the same. Use creative ideas as to how to make this app user friendly and helpful to client and his employees assuming the client has 5 employees.
